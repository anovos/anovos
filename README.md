_Anovos_ is an open source library for feature engineering at scale.
Built by data scientists & ML Engineers for the data science community,
it provides all the capabilities required for data ingestion, data analysis,
data drift & data stability analysis, feature recommendation and feature composition.
In addition, it automatically produces easily interpretable professional data reports
that help users understand the nature of data at first sight and further enable data
scientists to identify and engineer features.

Leveraging the power of [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) behind the scenes,
_Anovos_ improves data scientists' productivity and helps them build more resilient
and better performing models.

# Quick Start

The easiest way to try out _Anovos_ and explore its capabilities is through the provided
[examples](/examples) that you can run via Docker without the need to install anything
on your local machine.

```bash
# Launch an anovos-examples Docker container
sudo docker run -p 8888:8888 anovos/anovos-examples-3.2.1:latest
```

To reach the Jupyter environment, open the link to `http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token...`
generated by the Jupyter NotebookApp.

If you're not familiar with _Anovos_ or feature engineering, the _Getting Started with
Anovos_ guide is a good place to begin your journey.
You can find it in the `/guides` folder within the Jupyter environment.

For more detailed instructions on how to install Docker and how to troubleshoot potential
issues, see the [examples README](/examples/README.md).
