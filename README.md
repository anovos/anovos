_Anovos_ is an open source library for feature engineering at scale. Built by data scientist for the data science
community, it provides all capabilities required for data ingestion and transformation.

Leveraging the power of [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) behind the scenes, _Anovos_ improves data scientists'
productivity and helps them build more resilient and better performing models.

# Quick Start

The easiest way to try out _Anovos_ and explore its capabilities is through the provided
[examples](/examples) that you can run via Docker without the need to install anything on your local machine:

```bash
# clone the Git repository
git clone https://www.github.com/anovos/anovos.git
cd anovos/examples

# generate the Docker image (including Apache Spark and a Jupyter environment)
./create_anovos_examples_docker_image.sh

# Launch an anovos-examples Docker container
sudo docker run -p 8888:8888 anovos-examples:latest
```

To reach the Juypter environment, open the link to `http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token...` generated by the Jupyter
NotebookApp.

If you're not familiar with _Anovos_ or feature engineering, the _Getting Started with Anovos_ guide is a good place to
begin your journey. You can find it in the `guides` folder within the Jupyter environment.

For more detailed instructions, see the [examples README](/examples/README.md).
