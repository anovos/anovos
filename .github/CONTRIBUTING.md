Welcome to the Anovos Community! We're excited to bring the immense experience of the Mobilewalla team to the data science community, and we'd love to have you join us! Here you'll find all the details you need to get started as an Anovos contributor.

## Getting Started with Anovos

Anovos is an open source project that brings automation to the feature engineering process.

All repos, sample data, and notebooks you need are located in the  [Anovos Github Organization](https://github.com/anovos)

## How To Get Involved

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Testing out new features
- Contributing to the docs
- Giving talks about Anovos at Meetups, conferences and webinars

The latest information about how to interact with the project maintainers and broader community is kept in [COMMUNICATION.md](https://github.com/anovos/communication.md).

## Contribute to Anovos

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We use GitHub flow and everything happens through pull requests. We welcome your pull requests; to make it simple, here are the steps to contribute:

- Fork the repo you're updating and create your branch from main.
- If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
- If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
- Ensure the test suite passes.
- Issue that pull request!

Any contributions you make will be under the Apache Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same Apache License that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

### Write Thorough Commit Messages

Help reviewers know what you're contributing by writing good commit messages. To standardize how things are done, your first line of your commit is your _subject_, followed by a blank line, then a message describing what the commit does. We use the following guidelines suggested [by Chris Beams](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/):

#### Commit messages

The first line of the commit message is the _subject_, this should be followed by a blank line and then a message describing the intent and purpose of the commit. These guidelines are based upon a [post by Chris Beams](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

- When you run `git commit` make sure you sign-off the commit by typing `git commit --signoff` or `git commit -s`
- The commit subject-line should start with an uppercase letter
- The commit subject-line should not exceed 72 characters in length
- The commit subject-line should not end with punctuation (., etc)

Note: please do not use the GitHub suggestions feature, since it will not allow your commits to be signed-off.

When giving a commit body, be sure to:

- Leave a blank line after the subject-line
- Make sure all lines are wrapped to 72 characters

Here's an example that would be accepted:

```
Add luke to the contributors' _index.md file

We need to add luke to the contributors' _index.md file as a contributor.

Signed-off-by: Hans <hans@anovos.ai>
```

Some invalid examples:

```
(feat) Add page about X to documentation
```

> This example does not follow the convention by adding a custom scheme of `(feat)`

```
Update the documentation for page X so including fixing A, B, C and D and F.
```

> This example will be truncated in the GitHub UI and via `git log --oneline`
