You'll find the _Getting Started with Anovos_ guide within the `/guides` folder. We also provide a series of notebooks

experiment with.

## Installing, configuring, and troubleshooting Docker

To install Docker on your local machine, please refer to [the official guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/).

On some machines, the resources assigned to Docker are not sufficient to run the _Anovos_ examples.
They are known to work with the following configuration:

| Setting         | Value  |
|-----------------|--------|
| CPUs            | 6      |
| Memory          | 8.0 GB |
| Swap            | 1GB    |
| Disk Image Size | 24 GB  |
