# Anovos Spark Demo: Running workloads with Spark Submit

After checking out via Git clone, please follow the below instructions to run the E2E Anovos Package on the sample income dataset: 

1. First execute the following command to clean the base folder, run unit tests and prepare the latest modules package: 
	
```
make clean build test
```

2. If there is already a working environment with spark, the Demo can be run via the User's local environment directly (Note: version dependencies need to be ensured by user) <br>
For other environments, the Demo can be run using dockers

#### via User's local environment

1. Check the pre-requisites - ANOVOS requires Spark (2.4.x), Python (3.7.*), Java(8). Check version using the following commands: 
```
spark-submit --version
python --version
java -version
```
2. Set environment variables - `$JAVA_HOME`, `$SPARK_HOME`, `$PYSPARK_PYTHON`, and `$PATH`
3. Ensure spark-submit and pyspark is working without any issues.
4. Execute the following commands to run the end to end pipeline: 

```
cd dist/
nohup ./spark-submit.sh > run.txt &
```

5. Check result of end to end run

```
tail -f run.txt
```

Once the run has completed, the script will automatically open the final generated report `report_stats/ml_anovos_report.html` on the browser.

#### via Docker

Note: Kindly ensure the machine has ~15 GB free space atleast when running using Dockers
1. Install docker on your machine (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. Set docker settings to use atleast 8GB memory and 4+ cores. Below image shows setting docker settings on Docker Desktop:

</p>

3. Ensure dockers is successfully installed by executing the following commands to check docker image and docker container respectively:
```
docker image ls
docker ps
```

4. Create docker image and run E2E via Spark using the following command: (Note: Step #1 should have copied a "Dockerfile_spark_demo" and "create_anovos_spark_demo_image.sh" to the base directory)
	
```
./run_anovos_demo.sh
```

5. Once the run has completed, the script will automatically open the final generated report `ml_anovos_report.html` on the browser.
